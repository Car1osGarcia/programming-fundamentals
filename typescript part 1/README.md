# Day 3
##  object-oriented programming vs Functional programming 
<br>

### Definitions
<p> They are programming paradigms. They’re ways of coding that determine the type of tools we’ll have at our disposal and how we’re going to structure the internal architecture of our code.</p>

<p>OOP: The gist of it is that it tries to represent the real world through abstract constructions in your code. Essentially anything “real” about the problem you’re trying to solve can be represented as an object in OOP as well as anything abstract about it (making it easy to handle non-material concepts).</p>
<p>Functional Programming: focuses on behavior alone, in other words: functions. While OOP has the concept of classes and methods, and complex ways of dealing with these structures, functional programming tries to simplify all of this into one basic concept: functions.</p>

<br>

### Differences

| FP        |<p align="center"> OOP  </p>   |
|:-------------:| -----:|
|  <p align="justify">Concept of data and functions as a primary units to describe behavior.   </p> | <p align="justify">Concept of objects as units to describe world </p> |
|  <p align="justify">Considering behavior (functions) as a part of data</p>  |  <p align="justify">Strong separation between data and behavior.</p>  |
|  <p align="justify">Intention to inmutability</p>  |  <p align="justify">Shared mutable state is preserved.</p>  |

##  Fundamental Concepts of Object Oriented Programming

### Object
<p align="justify">
A thing from the real world. Objects are instances of classes created with specific data,
</p>

### Abstraction
<p align="justify">
To simply reality. for example if we want to manage workers we have a lot of them with different caracteristics but we can simplify as worker to refer a one of them.
</p>

### Class
<p align="justify">
A template to create objects and we can difine attributes and operations.
</p>

### Encapsultation
<p align="justify">
Hiding data and complexity. Containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
</p>

### Inheritance
<p align="justify">
Child classes can inherit methods and properties from parent class. 
</p>

### Polymorphism
<p align="justify">
Many methods can do the same task.
