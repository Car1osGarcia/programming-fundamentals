# Day 2
## principios SOLID
### The Single Responsibility Principle: states that a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

<br>

### The Open-Closed Principle: requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.

<br>

### The Liskov Substitution Principle: states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

<br>

### Interface Segregation: Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.

<br>

### Dependency Inversion principle: states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.
