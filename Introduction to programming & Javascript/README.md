##  Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages
<br>

### Interpreted programming languages
<p>These types of programming languages are executed while the interpreter is reading the line of code.</p>
<p>Examples of common interpreted languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.</p>

<br>
<br>

### Compiled programming languages

<p>These types of programming languages are first translated into machine code and then executed.</p>
<p>Examples of pure compiled languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go.</p>

<br>
<br>

## Pros and cons

|  | compiled        | interpreted   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Pros    | <p align="justify">1. Compiled into native machine code tend to be faster than interpreted code.   </p> | <p align="justify">1.Interpreted languages tend to be more flexible <br> 2. often offer features like dynamic typing and smaller program size</p> |
| Cons     | <p align="justify">1.Additional time needed to complete the entire compilation step before testing</p>      |   <p align="justify">1.typical execution speed compared to compiled languages.</p>  |

## Â¿Is java compiled or interpreted?
Java is a high level lenguage that is both compiled and interpreted because source code needs to be compiled into bytecode. Bytecode is a special machine language native to the JVM. The JVM interprets and executes this code at runtime.

## Pseudocode that  be used to convert dollars (USD) to bitcoin (BTC)

Assuming the current price is (1$ = 0.000043BTC)
```
1. START
2. Amount <-- GET
3. Bitcoin <-- Amount * 0.000043
4. Result <-- 'The amount ' + Amount + ' is equal to ' + Bitcoin
5. PRINT Result
6. END
```

## Low-Level and High-Level Programming Languages
### Low-level
<p>Low-level programs are expressed in terms of the machine operations that must be performed to carry out a task. This provides little or no abstraction. This makes writing programs more difficult, as the algorithm must be specified in terms of the capabilities and specifications of the processor.</p>

### High-level
<p>Are easier to read, write and maintain, developers dont have to worry in secondary things like register or memory management. They are also more independent of a specific computing system arquitecture.</p>
