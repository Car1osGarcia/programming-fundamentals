# Day 2
##  What is TypeScript and why would I use it in place of JavaScript?

TypeScript is a superset of the JavaScript language that has a single open-source compiler and is developed mainly by a single vendor: Microsoft. The goal of TypeScript is to help catch mistakes early through a type system and to make JavaScript development more efficient.

1. Support for modern JavaScript features - The JavaScript language (not the runtime) is standardized through the ECMAScript standards. Not all browsers and JavaScript runtimes support all features of all ECMAScript standards (see this overview). TypeScript allows for the use of many of the latest ECMAScript features and translates them to older ECMAScript targets of your choosing (see the list of compile targets under the --target compiler option).

2. Advanced type system - The type support is not part of the ECMAScript standard and will likely never be due to the interpreted nature instead of compiled nature of JavaScript. The type system of TypeScript is incredibly rich and includes: interfaces, enums, hybrid types, generics, union/intersection types, access modifiers and much more.

3. Developer tooling support - TypeScript's compiler can run as a background process to support both incremental compilation and IDE integration such that you can more easily navigate, identify problems, inspect possibilities and refactor your codebase.

### Sums of Parts

Exercise:
Let us consider this example (array written in general format):

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]

Its following parts:

The corresponding sums are (put together in a list): [20, 20, 19, 16, 10, 0]

The function parts_sums (or its variants in other languages) will take as parameter a list ls and return a list of the sums of its parts as defined above.

```typescript
export function partsSums(ls: number[]): number[] {

}
```
Solution:
```typescript
/** return the output array and ignore all non-op characters */
export function partsSums(ls: number[]): number[] {
  let newArray: number[]= [];
  ls.reverse().reduce((pv, cv)=>{
      newArray.push(pv+cv);
      return pv+cv;}
  ,0);
  newArray.reverse();
  newArray.push(0);
  return newArray;
}
```
<br>

### Consecutive strings

Exercise:
You are given an array(list) strarr of strings and an integer k. Your task is to return the first longest string consisting of k consecutive strings taken in the array.

Examples:
strarr = ["tree", "foling", "trashy", "blue", "abcdef", "uvwxyz"], k = 2

Concatenate the consecutive strings of strarr by 2, we get:

treefoling   (length 10)  concatenation of strarr[0] and strarr[1]
folingtrashy ("      12)  concatenation of strarr[1] and strarr[2]
trashyblue   ("      10)  concatenation of strarr[2] and strarr[3]
blueabcdef   ("      10)  concatenation of strarr[3] and strarr[4]
abcdefuvwxyz ("      12)  concatenation of strarr[4] and strarr[5]

Two strings are the longest: "folingtrashy" and "abcdefuvwxyz".
The first that came is "folingtrashy" so 
longest_consec(strarr, 2) should return "folingtrashy".

In the same way:
longest_consec(["zone", "abigail", "theta", "form", "libe", "zas", "theta", "abigail"], 2) --> "abigailtheta"
n being the length of the string array, if n = 0 or k > n or k <= 0 return "" (return Nothing in Elm, "nothing" in Erlang).

```typescript
export function longestConsec(strarr: string[], k: number): string {
}
```
Solution:
```typescript
/** return the output array and ignore all non-op characters */
export function longestConsec(strarr: string[], k: number): string {
  if( strarr.length==0 || k>strarr.length || k<=0) return ""
  let newArray: string[]=[];
  let piv: string []=[strarr[0]];
  
  strarr.reduce((pv,cv)=>{
    while(piv.length>=k){
      piv.shift()
    }
    piv.push(cv);
    newArray.push(piv.join(''));
    return cv;
  })

  let max:string=newArray[0];
  for(let n of newArray ){
    if(n.length>max.length){
      max=n;
    }
  }
  return max;
}
```
